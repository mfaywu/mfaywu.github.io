## TIL

# Things I learned today:
- Bloomberg terminals look a little ridiculous and old-school, are super full-featured, and apparently very well liked (I even thought it was pretty cool after a while).
- How to use my personal Github account to commit to this (personal) blog while on my work computer. [link to come]
- Create a new Jekyll blog within an existing repo by emptying out the repo and running `jekyll new .`
- Learning a language is hard when you're by yourself. I've decided to find an Italian tutor so that I can stay motivated, learn faster, and have someone to direct my progress.

# Q's:
- How to generate a new Jekyll page with auto headers (i.e., date already populated with current datetime)
- How to use Git, VS Code, tmux more effectively
